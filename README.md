# Kokkos_internal

[![CI](https://github.com/Quntized/Kokkos_internal/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Quntized/Kokkos_internal/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This repository contains all the files inside `kokkos`, the repository's test files (apart from Kokkos). My entire goal for this project is to debug in Kokkos and find any potential issue hidden in internal functions. 

This repo will have distinct file containing internal test cases. (Currently it only contains the dynamic rank part, kokkos_pair, raw mdspan (a bit) and further will be added in future)

## Additional Project Linked to this Repo:

1) [CMake_project](https://github.com/Quntized/CMake_project_preparation):
    In this repository systematically approach which is used in Kokkos cmake files, using official [CMake](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/index.html) and as well as [Kokkos_CMake](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/tree/develop/cmake) for proper investigation.
2) [Cuda_code](https://github.com/Quntized/Cuda_code):
    In this repository the kokkos official cuda folder investigation [Kokkos_Cuda](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/tree/develop/core/src/Cuda) and as well as [Cuda](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-programming-guide/index.html) official documentations used for proper investigation.

3) [DiscDomComKok](https://github.com/Quntized/DiscDomCom) : In this repository I tried some idea and tried some initial phase though not able to perfectly implement it. But I could work in future. If you find it useful, you can knock me. We can discuss grabbing with coffee. I would really appreciate.



## Quick Build (self-contained)


You can build with either way.

The project fetches Kokkos automatically via CMake `FetchContent`:

```bash
cmake -B build -S . \
    -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++ \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DKokkos_ENABLE_SERIAL=ON \
    -DKokkos_ENABLE_OPENMP=ON
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

## Build with a pre-installed Kokkos

If you already have Kokkos built locally, point CMake at it:

```bash
# First build Kokkos (one-time):
git clone https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos.git
cmake -B kokkos/build -S kokkos \
    -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++ \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DKokkos_ENABLE_OPENMP=ON \
    -DKokkos_ARCH_NATIVE=ON \
    -DKokkos_ENABLE_DEPRECATED_CODE_4=OFF
cmake --build kokkos/build

# Then build this project:
cmake -B build -S . -DKokkos_DIR=kokkos/build
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

**Note** : coding agent was used only for code review as i work independently, i need a tool for checking things, that's why. 

Thank you for your time.
